/**
 * The Apartment class represents an apartment in a webshop. Like the Vehicle
 * class, the Apartment class should inherit the Product class.
 *
 * In real life an apartment would likely have additional properties, such as
 * the number of rooms, the size in square meters, the floor number, etc. In
 * this exercise, you can decide yourself which properties you want to add. You
 * can also decide yourself how the toString() method should look like.
 *
 * This class will not be autograded, so it is up to you to test it. You can
 * also skip this class and continue with the next part of the exercise if you
 * feel that you have understood the concept of inheritance.
